# 🚀 Automate Revit Rooms and Areas Scheduling – No Coding Required  

Easily export all **Rooms** and **Areas** by Level into an Excel file in seconds, ensuring **accurate and up-to-date project data**. This automation **eliminates manual effort**, **reduces errors**, and provides a **structured format** for further analysis.  

Seamlessly integrate the exported data with **reporting tools** or **dashboards** to enhance project tracking and decision-making.  

---

## 📏 Follow Your Standards  

Define **Area KPI metrics** based on your company’s standards to ensure **consistency and accuracy** across all projects.  

With clear benchmarks, you can:  
✅ Track performance  
✅ Optimize space utilization  
✅ Make data-driven decisions  

By automating this process, each **new model version** can be compared against predefined criteria—ensuring compliance and efficiency.  

---

## 🔎 Never Miss a Detail  

Every time a **new model version** is published from Revit, all **Rooms and/or Areas** are **automatically exported** into an Excel file.  

This guarantees that:  
✔ No data is missed  
✔ You have a reliable record of spatial changes over time  
✔ Your project data remains structured and up to date  

---

## 📊 **See Results Clearly**  

Each time a **new model version** is published, Revit will export **all Rooms and/or Areas** for each Level into an Excel file, providing a **clear and structured** dataset for analysis.  

### ✨ **Optional: Set Up KPI Metrics**  

You can track key **Area KPI metrics** such as:  

- **NUA** – Net Usable Area  
- **NIA** – Net Internal Area  
- **NLA** – Net Leasable Area  
- **GIA** – Gross Internal Area  
- **GEA** – Gross External Area  
- **GLA** – Gross Leasable Area  
- **GBA** – Gross Building Area  

### ⚡ How to Define KPI Metrics  

⚠️To calculate a KPI metric, use the **exact names** of the **Rooms** and/or **Areas** you want to combine.  

#### Example: **Office Building – Net Internal Area (NIA)**  
In an office building, **NIA** is typically calculated by summing up the areas for:  
- **Office**  
- **Amenities**  
- **Storage**  
- **Primary Circulation**  

Simply separate these names with commas when defining your metric.
